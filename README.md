### Windy plugins - SkewT

This windy plugin plot a skewT-logP diagram. SkewTs (more common in the U.S.) are similar to tephigrams (more common in Europe), the difference mainly being the orientation of the isobars.

Open the picker (by clicking anywhere on the windy map) to start the plugin. The solid black curve represents the temperature throughout the atmosphere (in pressure coordinates), while the dashed black curve is the dew point temperature. When these lines are close, humidity is high and clouds are likely. 

The wind through the atmosphere is also shown, represented by wind barbs in units of knots. The quantities of wind, temperature, pressure and altitude at any level can be seen by hovering the mouse over the skewT window.


### Current features

The skewT plugin is designed to visualise model data from windy, but this data has not yet been made available. Therefore as it stands, the plugin shows **sample data only**. This sample data is from a run of the Global Forecast Sytem (GFS) model from December 2018. Hopefully, the plugin will work with current model data soon, this will depend on windy allowing the plugin to access it.
