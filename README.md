SkewT project for windy.com.

![Alt text](skewt.png)

Install the plugin by selecting "Install Windy plugin" from the setting menu on windy.com, and entering "windy-plugin-skewt". Then right-click on the map to find the plugin.

At the moment the ECMWF is not available for windy plugins, so the GFS will display whenever ECMWF is selected. You can hover over the skewt to get point data along the curves.
