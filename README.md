### Windy plugins - SkewT

This plugin creates and plots a skewT-logP diagram based on weather model data. SkewTs (more common in the U.S.) are similar to tephigrams (more common in Europe), the difference mainly being the orientation of the isobars.

Open the picker (by clicking anywhere on the windy map) to start the plugin. The solid black curve represents the temperature throughout the atmosphere (in pressure coordinates), while the dashed black curve is the dew point temperature. When these lines are close, humidity is high and clouds are likely. 

The wind through the atmosphere is also shown, represented by wind barbs in units of knots. The quantities of wind, temperature, pressure and altitude at any level can be seen by hovering the mouse over the skewT window.

The skewT window will drag with the map, and you can move the picker to get a new skewT on the fly. To close the skewT, simply close the picker. 

windy-plugin-skewt works temporally, so just move the time slider or press the play button to see the skewT's evolution in time. Also, you can change the model and see how the curves differ. 

windy-plugins-SkewT is based on code from www.tephigrams.org. Both were written by John C. Kealy. Email me at j.kealy@exeter.ac.uk with any comments, questions or suggestions.
