# Untitled sunset article

My favourite colour is purple. I remember exactly which day I decided this too; sitting atop a 200m-high cliff in Hawaii, watching the sky turn from green, to pink, to orange, to violet – I don't know many people who dislike sunsets in the tropics. 

At 200m elevation, the horizon is 50km away. The view over the ocean makes for a spectacular panorama to mirror the sky, and you can see many more of the clouds that make sunset so special. Clouds, in case you hadn't guessed, are the key to a good sunset. We get too many in the mid-latitudes, but the tropics tend to create the perfect conditions for that "Goldilocks" effect – not too many, not too few. Cloud altitude comes into play a lot, and the wispy, ethereal clouds known as cirrus are usually the key. 

My Hawaiian friends spent a lot of time making sure I understood the following mantra: "The sun sets and THEN the show begins." Too many poor souls are lost to other distractions when that giant orb dips below the horizon, but get the right day, and things can get very interesting afterward. If there's any cirrus cloud around, it'll light-up last because of its high altitude, and it's icy composition will diffract and scatter the light in every direction. 

Thunderstorms can also really pay off. Although tropical rains can be a bit of a pain during the day, the clouds they leave behind when the rain ends can often turn to cirrus before they dissipate completely, and if you're lucky, you might even see a thunderstorm evolving somewhere else in the sky, with the setting sun lighting up the tops of these massive cumulonimbus clouds, not to mention the lightning within. 

 The question I'm most often asked is how to predict a good sunset.
